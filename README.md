This assignment shows that you got your web server working, and that you can write a simple web site using the native web technologies.

Description:
After following the instructions to install the Apache web server on your laptop, write your home web page. Your web page should include assets from each of these file types: HTML, CSS, JS, PNG. You only need one file each of those file types, but you can include more if you wish. The script (JS) file doesn't have to be complex... it can do something simple. Your home page can display whatever you like, such as showing your course projects or accomplishments.
